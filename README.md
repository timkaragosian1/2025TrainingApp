# 2025 Training App for Android Kotlin Compose Reference

This application was developed by Tim "TJ" Karagosian solo and is intended to be used as reference for modern android practices in common functionality and patterns. These include MVVM, testing, navigation, API calls, DB interactions, and more.

Feel free to save and use as a reference as a simple model for general use to scale and expand upon for further functionality for future projects.

Current state of the project 7/12/25 is:
- Sign In functionality and Tests work as expected and just need integration testing around the API calls
- Home functionality is proper and has tests for VM and Screen, but still needs a screenshot test.
- History and Flow Details need to be reworked to be more like Sign In and Home design patterns and testing.
- User/Pass functionality needs work between Dev/Prod build variants
- Working @Preview for the screens
- Splash screen with animations on app start
- Snackbar showing has issues
