This application was developed by Tim "TJ" Karagosian solo and is intended to be used as reference for modern android practices in common functionality and patterns. These include MVVM, testing, navigation, API calls, DB interactions, and more.

Feel free to save and use as a reference as a simple model for general use to scale and expand upon for further functionality for future projects.
